    "## Review of Days 1 + 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to day 3 of our python intensive course. This is the last day of the \"introduction to computer science\" part of the course, after which we will move on to the \"introduction to data science\" part. Let's review what we have learned so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A computer program is a sequence of instructions that is read from top to bottom and executed by the computer. You need to give it extremely precise instructions. It's helpful to use **pseudocode** to plan our the logic of your program before you apply the **syntax** of your programming language.\n",
    "2. **Variables** are assigned to data using the `=` operator.\n",
    "3. **Functions** are blocks of code that are executed when called. You can also think of operators as functions that take arguments on both sides.\n",
    "4. We learned about various data types, including **integers**, **strings**, and **booleans** and how various operators work with them. Knowing what data type you are working with is very important!\n",
    "5. **Conditional statements** like `if`, `elif`, `else` allow you to control the flow of the program, skipping code that doesn't need to be executed.\n",
    "6. **Loops** like `for` and `while` allow you to repeat code multiple times. For while loops, it's important to make sure that it will end by using an update variable. For loops use iterables to repeat code.\n",
    "7. **Iterables** are objects that can be looped over, like **lists**, **dictionaries**, and **strings**. They are indexed starting at 0 and can be sliced using the `:` operator.\n",
    "8. **Lists** are a basic data structure that store multiple values. They are indexed by their position in the list.\n",
    "9. While learning about lists, we learned about methods, which are functions that are attached to objects and can modify that object **in place** or give you information about that object.\n",
    "10. **Dictionaries** are another type of basic data structure that store key-value pairs. They are indexed by their keys.\n",
    "11. How to write **functions** of your own and either print the results or return the values."

    "  1. Walk_anywhere(distance=2 meters and angle=40째).\n",
    "  2. Extend your arm towards the power button.\n",
    "  3. Push the power button.\n",

    "  10. Pull the cabinet open.\n",
    "  11. Release the cabinet handle.\n",
    "  12. Extend both arms toward the large mixing bowl on the shelf.\n",
    "  13. Grasp the mixing bowl with both hands.\n",
    "  .\n",
    "  .\n",
    "  .\n",
    "  and so on.\n",
    "```\n",

    "Elsewhere in the recipe book are step-by-step instructions for certain tasks, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Walk_anywhere(*distance*, *angle*):\n",
    "  1. Turn body *angle* degrees\n",
    "  2. Repeat Step until the *distance* has been traversed\n",

    "  4. Extend left leg.\n",
    "  5. Lower left leg and lift right leg.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These recipes are analogous to **functions**, and because they already exist in the recipe book, we can think of them as **built-in functions**, those that come with your Python installation. We've learned about a lot of these, like `len()` for iterables, `sum()` for a list of numbers, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are lots of other chefs out there writing their own recipes, and they may make their recipe books available to anyone who wants them. This is great because you may end up needing to cook some similar recipes, in which case you can go to the public library or the bookstore and pick up their book to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming terms, this is referred to as **importing a library**. The **library** written by someone else will have extra functions that, once imported, you can use in your program. **Libraries may also be referred to as modules**, among other names.\n",

Try and follow some consistent naming conventions with regard to capitalization and underscores. It'll be easier to remember what your functions are called if you don't mix up conventions like \"plot\" and \"Plot\" or \"plot_this\" and \"plotThis\". For more guidance, see the [python style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions).\n",

    "Another tip for writing good functions: it is best practice to **document** it with what it does. That way, when future you or someone else reads it, the function's useage is immediately clear. You can annotate functions with a triple quote at the beginning of a function body, which is called a **docstring**. Typical contents of a docstring are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* one sentence describing the usage\n",
    "* list of all parameters and what type they should be\n",

    "One quick string concept to cover before we move on to other topics is **f-strings**. F-strings are a way to format strings in Python. The way they work is to start a string with the keyword `f`, preceding the first quotation mark. Then, whenever you need to insert a variable within the string that has previously been assigned, you surround that variable name with `{}`. Think of `{}` as a carve-out from the string where code is valid again.\n",
