    "## Review of Days 1 + 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to day 3 of our python intensive course. This is the last day of the \"introduction to computer science\" part of the course, after which we will move on to the \"introduction to data science\" part. Let's review what we have learned so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A computer program is a sequence of instructions that is read from top to bottom and executed by the computer. You need to give it extremely precise instructions. It's helpful to use **pseudocode** to plan our the logic of your program before you apply the **syntax** of your programming language.\n",
    "2. **Variables** are assigned to data using the `=` operator.\n",
    "3. **Functions** are blocks of code that are executed when called. You can also think of operators as functions that take arguments on both sides.\n",
    "4. We learned about various data types, including **integers**, **strings**, and **booleans** and how various operators work with them. Knowing what data type you are working with is very important!\n",
    "5. **Conditional statements** like `if`, `elif`, `else` allow you to control the flow of the program, skipping code that doesn't need to be executed.\n",
    "6. **Loops** like `for` and `while` allow you to repeat code multiple times. For while loops, it's important to make sure that it will end by using an update variable. For loops use iterables to repeat code.\n",
    "7. **Iterables** are objects that can be looped over, like **lists**, **dictionaries**, and **strings**. They are indexed starting at 0 and can be sliced using the `:` operator.\n",
    "8. **Lists** are a basic data structure that store multiple values. They are indexed by their position in the list.\n",
    "9. While learning about lists, we learned about methods, which are functions that are attached to objects and can modify that object **in place** or give you information about that object.\n",
    "10. **Dictionaries** are another type of basic data structure that store key-value pairs. They are indexed by their keys.\n",
    "11. How to write **functions** of your own and either print the results or return the values."
