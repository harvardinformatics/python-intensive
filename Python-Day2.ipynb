    "# Python intensive, day 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome (back) to the Harvard Informatics Python workshop. This is day two of six, where we aim to give a whirlwind, yet thorough, introduction programming concepts, the Python programming language, and how to use Python and some popular libaries to facilitate data analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yesterday, we learned some foundational programming concepts and how they are implemented in Python. Specifically, we learned about:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   How computers need every single step given to them in order to complete a task with programming. This requires the programmer to conceptualize a problem at a high level, perhaps with **pseudocode**, and then break down that problem in every single step.\n",
    "2.   Data can be stored and manipulated in a program by assigning it to an internal **variable** name with the assignment operator (`=`).\n",
    "3.   **Functions** are blocks of code that perform a specific task and can be \"looked up\" from another program - like another recipe in a recipe book. Functions require input in the form of **arguments** and **return** output.\n",
    "4.   **Operators** are functions that perform universal tasks, such as `+` for the addition of integers.\n",
    "5.   Functions and operators may work on specific **data types**, such as **strings** or **integers**. It is important to remember what data type your function expects.\n",
    "6.   **Boolean** (`True` or `False`) is a data type that allows programmers to express and evaluate complex logical statements. Booleans have operators that work on them, such as `and`, `or`, and `not`.\n",
    "7.   **Conditional** (`if`, `elif`, `else`) statements allow programmers to execute certain blocks of code depending on the state of the data in their program by testing logical conditions. Data is compared with **comparison operators** such as `>`, `==`, or `in`.\n",
    "8.   **Loops** (`while`, `for`) allow sets of instructions to be automatically repeated depending on the conditions of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will build on this by learning about **iterable data structures**, which will enhance what we can do with `for` loops, and we will learn to write our own functions.\n",

    "\n",
    "If for some reason Google Colab isn't working, or you prefer to run this locally, you will need to install python, anaconda, and the necessary libraries. You will have to follow these steps to do so. Note that some steps are only meant for specific operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "0. If you are on Windows, [install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Once WSL is installed, you'll have a Linux terminal available to you in Windows. You can open this terminal by typing \"wsl\" in the search bar and clicking the app that appears. You'll also find your Linux distribution as a mounted drive in your file explorer.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install mamba, a package manager using the command line - Terminal for Mac or WSL for Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.1. For Mac, if you already have brew installed, install mamba using `brew install miniforge` and initialize it using `conda init zsh`. Then restart your terminal. If you don't have homebrew (i.e. the brew command doesn't exist), install brew first using `/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.2. For Windows, download the Linux (x86_64) installer from the miniforge repository [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) and install with `bash Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a new environment using mamba with `mamba create -n pyworkshop numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter` and activate it with `conda activate pyworkshop`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You can now run the jupyter notebook by typing `jupyter notebook` in the terminal. This will open a browser window with the jupyter notebook interface. You can navigate to the folder where you saved this notebook and open it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Alternatively, install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the Python extension. Then open this notebook in VSCode and run it with the kernel that belongs to the pyworkshop environment. [How to guide here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)\n",

    "\n",
    "To re-iterate some of the concepts we talked about at the beginning of yesterday's workshop, let's start with a joke about computer programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sam asks their computer programmer spouse to go get some groceries. Sam tells him, \"Please go to the store to get some groceries. Buy a loaf of bread. If they have eggs, get a dozen.\" The spouse comes back with 13 loaves of bread. This joke is funny if you understand how computer programs evaluate commands.\n",

    "if eggs:\n",
    "    loaf_of_bread += 12\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This joke illustrates that what may make sense in natural language does not immediately translate to computer language. And therefore we have to be really specific, giving every instruction even, when we're programming."

    "Let's recall the recipe to get a robot to bake us some chocolate chip cookies. We left our recipe in this state:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  1. Walk_anywhere(distance=2 and angle=40).\n",
    "  2. Extend your arm towards the power button.\n",
    "  3. Push the power button.\n",
    "  4. Move your arm to the temperature dial.\n",
    "  5. Set the temperature dial to 375°F (190°C).\n",

    "  7. Walk_anywhere(distance=0.6 and angle=120).\n",
    "  8. Extend your arm.\n",
    "  9. Grasp the cabinet handle.\n",
    "  10. Pull the cabinet open.\n",
    "  11. Release the cabinet handle.\n",

    "  .\n",
    "  .\n",
    "  .\n",
    "  and so on.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We also had these other recipes in our recipe book that the robot could look up everytime it saw them in our main recipe:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Step:\n",
    "  1. Lift right leg.\n",
    "  2. Extend right leg.\n",
    "  3. Lower right leg and lift left leg.\n",
    "  4. Extend left leg.\n",
    "  5. Lower left leg and lift right leg.\n",
    "\n",

    "  1. Turn body *angle* degrees\n",
    "  2. Repeat Step until the *distance* has been traversed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We now know that these sub-recipes are called **functions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our main recipe, we've called `Walk_anywhere()` twice, first to get the robot to the oven, then to get to the cabinet.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, what if before it starts baking the cookies, the robot is already standing at the oven? While we could call `Walk_anywhere(distance=0, angle=0)`, it would be kind of pointless, and it may waste valuable time - those few seconds it takes us to lookup the `Walk_anywhere()` recipe only to have to immediately flip back to the main recipe are going to delay us from our cookies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a perfect situation to check the **conditions** of our program, and only execute the `Walk_anywhere()` function if certain conditions are True (or not True, depending on the context).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this, we need one more piece of information in our recipe: our current location. Then our recipe may look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  The current location is in front of the oven.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. If we aren't at our oven, Walk_anywhere(distance=2 and angle=40).\n",

    "  .\n",
    "  .\n",
    "  .\n",
    "  and so on.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we've given the robot's location and we've said in step 1, only execute `Walk_anywhere()` **if** is isn't already at our oven. Now our robot knows not to bother looking up and running `Walk_anywhere()` in this case. We could change the location accordingly in the recipe and the robot would know whether or not it needed to `Walk_anywhere()`. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  The current location is in the living room.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. If we aren't at our oven, Walk_anywhere(distance=2 and angle=40).\n",
    "  2. Extend your arm towards the power button.\n",
    "  3. Push the power button.\n",
    "  .\n",
    "  .\n",
    "  .\n",
    "  and so on.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make our pseudocode look a little bit more programmatic by doing the following:\n",
    "1. Make the current location a string variable using the `=` asignment operator.\n",
    "2. In the conditional **if statement**, use a logical comparison between strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  current_location = \"living room\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. If current_location != \"oven\", Walk_anywhere(distance=2 and angle=40).\n",
    "  2. Extend your arm towards the power button.\n",
    "  3. Push the power button.\n",
    "  .\n",
    "  .\n",
    "  .\n",
    "  and so on.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We of course would also have to update the `distance` and `angle` arguments in our function call to be dependent on the `current_location`, but we can ignore that for now.\n",

    "You've probably seen the lines of code starting with the `#` symbol (known as a number sign, hashtag, pound sign, or octothorp) throughout our workshop. These lines are called **comments**. Comments must start with `#` but afterwards can contain anything, even python keywords like `in`, `if`, `for`, etc. This is because that Python is programmed such that if the interpreter encounters a line starting with `#`, it simply ignores it. It does not try to execute it as a line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows programmers to document their code in fine detail, section-by-section or even line-by-line. A good rule of thumb is to write a comment for every chunk of code that does something specific, or if it is not obvious why you had to write code that way. These comments will primarily benefit yourself for when you go back to your code and ask yourself, \"Why did I do it this way?\". It is also good practice to have comments exist on their own line rather than in-line with your code."
