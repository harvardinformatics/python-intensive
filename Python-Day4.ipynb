    "## Base Python Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lists** are one the most flexible of data structures in Python. They are created with `[]` and can contain any type of data. Each **element** in a list is separated by a comma. Lists are ordered and can be indexed, sliced, and concatenated just like strings. When lists are all numerical, they can also support mathematical operations like `max()` and `min()`. Lists can also be nested using another `[]` within the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are our first introduction to a **mutable** data structure, meaning you can change a list without having to create a new one. Indeed, list methods may modify your data **in place** and/or **return** a new object. If the method modifies the object in place, its return value will be `None`. Modifying in place means you don't have to assign the result of the method to a new variable, while returning a new object means you do have to assign it. For example, `list.append(x)` updates the list in place, while `list.pop()` both returns the last element and removes it from the list in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some useful operations and methods for lists. For a full list of methods, you can use `help()` on the list or consult the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list) page.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operations and methods for lists**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation/Method | Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| `+` | Concatenation |\n",
    "| `*` | Repetition |\n",
    "| `[]`, `[:]` | Indexing, slicing |\n",
    "| `.append(x)` | Add `x` to the end of the list |\n",
    "| `.extend([x, y, z])` | Add `[x, y, z]` to the end of the list |\n",
    "| `.insert(i, x)` | Add `x` at index `i` of the list |\n",
    "| `.pop(i)` | Remove and return the element at index `i`, defaults to last element if none given |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use cases for lists**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are a data structure that is always there in the background, being useful. We see them when creating simple ordered collections to iterate through, when we need to store a sequence of data to reference later, or when we need to collected a bunch of objects together. Think of lists as a small temporary transport for data. Lists are not good for large datasets (because it will be slow) or when you need to do a lot of mathematical operations (because it lacks functionality).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dictionaries** store **key:value pairs**. Keys must be immutable and are typically strings or numerical identifiers, while the values can be just about anything, including other dictionaries, lists, or individual values. You can create a dictionary with `{}` or with the `dict()` function. The two ways to create a dictionary are shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n",
    "my_dict = dict((\"a\", 1), (\"b\", 2), (\"c\", 3))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent versions of Python (3.8+), dictionaries keys maintain the order in which they were added, which is useful to maintain consistency when looping over the keys. However, in previous versions of Python, dictionaries were unordered. You can't index or slice dictionaries (since dictionary elements aren't accessed by index). But you can retrieve items by their key, e.g. `my_dict[\"a\"]` or `my_dict.get(\"a\")`. Like lists, dictionaries are mutable, so you can add, remove, or update the key:value pairs in place. Other methods return \"View objects\" that allow you to see the items in the dictionary, but won't allow you to modify the dictionary, however these objects can usually be easily converted to lists with the `list()` function. Here are some useful methods for dictionaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operations and methods for dictionaries**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation/Method | Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| `[<key>]` | Retrieve value by key |\n",
    "| `.keys()` | Returns a view object of the keys |\n",
    "| `.values()` | Returns a view object of the values |\n",
    "| `.items()` | Returns a view object of the key:value pairs |\n",
    "| `.update(dict)` | Updates the dictionary with the key:value pairs from another dictionary |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use cases for dictionaries**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are a data structure that is more specialized for information that can be organized in a key:value pair way. You may see dictionaries being used to store associations between a name/ID and some characteristics, or to store a set of parameters for a function, or to organize a hierarchical grouping of information. Dictionaries are optimized for fast access to the values by key and for flexible organization of the data. Although you can edit the values of a dictionary, they aren't good for mathematical operations or for ordered data."

    "\n",
    "Programming involves reading primarily documentation, but also code, search results, stackexchange queries, etc. These are just a few examples of what you'll read as you work on code. Reading the documentation of a package or library or software that you are using should probably be the first thing you do when you start using it. However, software docs pages are a much different sort of writing than we may be used to, if we're primarily used to reading journal articles, textbooks, and protocols. Knowing how and how much to read documentation is a skill that needs to be developed over time to suit your own needs. There's definitely no need to read every single page of documentation of a piece of software, especially for large libraries like `numpy` or `matplotlib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There are a variety of ways software can be documented**\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be handed a single script from a colleague to perform some action and that script may have **comments** in the code detailing what it does or what certain lines do. Individual functions may have what is called a **docstring**, which is a string that occurs immediately after the function definition detailing how do use that function, inputs, and outputs. Another type of documentation is a docs page or **API reference** on a website for that software, such as the page for the seaborn's [scatterplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.scatterplot.html) function. Many software packages also have some introductory pages like **vignettes** or **tutorials** that guide you through the basics of the software. The [Getting started tutorials](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html) of Pandas is a good example of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What documentation are we meant to read?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, documentation is meant to be a reference manual more than a textbook. A lot of documentation is really repetitive, because it has to exhaustively cover every single function, class, and use-case available to the user. I do not recommend reading documentation like a book or in any linear way. That's like learning a foreign language by reading the dictionary. For example, `numpy` has a variety of [mathematical functions](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.math.html), but you are not required to look at the doc page of each of those. It is enough to know that it exists and when you do want to use a particular one, to check the page of that specific function. The most important parts of the documentation to read first are the tutorials/user guides, which introduce the basic functionality of the software with some example code. Often times, this code is exactly what you need to get started. If you get stuck, then it's time to read the docs pages for the specific commands you are using."

    "### Reading data line by line\n",
    "\n",
    "A common way to read data in Python is line by line. This is useful when you have a file that is too large to fit into memory all at once. You can read the file line by line and process each line as you go. This is also useful when you need to parse a file that has a specific structure so that it can be read into a data structure like a numpy array or pandas dataframe. In this section, when we talk about files, we mean text files that contain data that exist on your local machine. This is different from the data structures we've been working with so far, which are in memory (in your python instance).\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for opening a file is `open(filename, mode)`, where mode can be `r` for reading, `w` for writing, `a` for appending. Reading mode means that you can only read the file but not change it (on the disk). Writing mode means you are creating a new file or overwriting an existing file. Appending mode means you are adding to an existing file.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a file, you can read it line by line using a `for` loop. While there are several ways to open a file in Python, the most efficient is with the `with` keyword, which will automatically close the file once you've done what you need. Here's an example of how that might look with a for loop to print each line of a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('filename.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    for line in file:\n",
    "        print(line)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code will print each line of the file to the console. Notice the use of the keyword `as`, similar to how we setup an **alias** when we import a library. Here it serves a similar purpose, giving us a name to refer to the file object we've opened. We can name it anything we want, but `file` was just an example. The `line` variable is how we refer to each line of the file as we iterate through it. Again, it's an arbitrary name.\n",
    "\n",
    "This for loop is similar to how we iterate through a list. The only difference is that we're iterating through something that is being read from our local computer rather than an object in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example, we are only printing the lines of the file, but just as with any for loop, you can do anything you want with each line, such as apply a function to it, split it up and store it in a data structure, or write different parts of it to a new file. So think of that `print(line)` line as a placeholder for whatever you want to do with the line.\n",

You can create numpy arrays using the `np.array()` function (after running `import numpy as np`) or by converting other data structures to an array using `np.asarray()` or other helper functions. There are also many functions that can create an array with pre-filled numbers, such as `np.zeros()` and `np.arange()`. An array is defined by its `shape`, which describes the number of elements in each dimension, also known as **axes**. The first axis is the number of rows, the second is the number of columns, and so on for higher dimensional data.\n",

However, our original csv did not have that much precision. This is because numpy internally loaded our data in this format but just didn't display the whole thing for us. We can change a number's **display format** using the `fmt` argument. Here's how you would save the data with 3 decimal places. You will also notice that we took the `wines_header` variable and joined it into a single string with commas. This is because `np.savetxt()` expects a single string for the header row."
