    ">**Question:** How many hours are there between 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM on a given date? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Any number between 0 and 13, depending on the time zones of the two locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time, as we all know, is a human construct that is on its face numerical, but is also more complex than simple numbers. Consider all that we do with dates and times: we want to compare time, do arithmetic to find time intervals, aggregate by year, month, day, day of the week, etc. Time consists of many different units and cannot be simply added or coded. Consider that there are a variable number of days in a month, and some months have different number of days on certain years (leap days). Then, we might want to measure durations of time, or keep track of time stamps specific to a location and date. These require computers to think of time in different ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has an implementation of datetime objects called `pd.datetime`. Consider this akin to the `str` object for strings, or the `int` object for integers. This object has a lot of built-in functionality that makes it easy to work with dates and times. But before we learn how to convert data to this object type, let's go over a few basic tips for how to record your time data. \n",
    "\n",
    "* If you just want to record the date, use the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. When you convert to a `pd.datetime` object, it will automatically set the time to midnight with no time zone information. This is called a \"naive\" datetime object.\n",
    "* If you need to record a timestamp - e.g. the time and date something happened - use the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS+0500`. This is the ISO 8601 standard format for datetime objects. The `+0500` is the time zone offset from GMT. When pandas parses this string, it will create what is called an \"aware\" datetime object. ***Good data practice is to always record your times in this format and to always include the time zone offset*** unless you are absolutely sure that A. Everything happens in the same time zone and you'll never have to compare to another dataset, and B. None of your data will be affected by daylight savings time.\n",
    "* If you need to record a time series, you want to record the time a `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` (ISO 8601 again) but import the data as **time deltas**, aka `pd.Timedelta`. This is a special type of datetime object that represents the difference between two times. This is useful if the duration, and not the specific time of day, matters the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is an essential library for time series analysis that many other libraries build upon. See the docs for more information on how pandas handles date [time objects](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/timeseries.html) and [time deltas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/timedeltas.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you aren't doing time series analysis, you will find it useful to import any column of dates or times as a datetime object, as it will provide you with a lot of useful functionality. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pandas can automatically parse human readable dates and times written in various formats into a standardized `datetime` object. [docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.to_datetime.html)\n",
    "* You can extract various components of the date/time for analysis or printing purposes. See the list of attributes and method of the `pd.Timestamp` class [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Timestamp.html), which include `day_of_week`, `day_of_year`, `weekofyear`, `.day_name()`, etc. \n",
    "* You can perform calculations on dates and times, such as converting between time zones, finding the difference (**delta**) between two times, resampling the frequency of a time series, or finding the time that is a certain duration away from a given time. \n",
    "* You can control how the date is displayed when you print it out or export your data by using string format codes specific for datetime objects. [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#format-codes) \n",
