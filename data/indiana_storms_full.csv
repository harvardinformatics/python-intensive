The supercell over southwest Indiana produced three tornadoes along its track across Vanderburgh, Warrick, and Spencer Counties. The storms encountered a moderately unstable air mass and sufficient deep-layer wind shear for storm organization. Mixed-layer capes around 1000 to 1500 j/kg were supported by temperatures in the upper 70's and dew points in the lower 60's. This instability, coupled with effective wind shear near 40 knots, supported supercell activity with tornadoes.",,CSV

Numerous vehicle crashes and slide-offs occurred. Isolated power outages were reported due to tree limbs on power lines. A utility company estimated outages totaled about 500 customers. Downed tree limbs damaged vehicles at the campus of Southern Indiana University. Several east-to-west bands of light to locally moderate precipitation advanced slowly northward in response to the arrival of warm, moist air in the low levels. Strengthening of a southerly low level jet occurred ahead of a 500 mb shortwave impulse emerging out of the central Plains. Convective enhancement of precipitation rates was observed. After the precipitation changed to rain, the combination of snowmelt and rainfall produced localized street flooding. Most of the street flooding was in urban areas, such as Evansville.",,CSV
