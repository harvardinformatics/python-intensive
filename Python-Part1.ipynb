    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first part of the Harvard Informatics Python intensive workshop. This is a six day workshop intended to give a quick, yet thorough, introduction to programming concepts, the Python programming language, and how to use Python to facilitate data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmatic analysis of data allows scientist to have full control over how their data is parsed, assessed, and presented, unlike using third party programs (like Excel) which may make unwanted assumptions about how you want to read your data. The upside of this is that one could conceivably perform any analysis imaginable on their data, assuming they have enough coding skills. The downside is that one must know how to program. But that is the goal of this workshop: to give you the understanding of programming concepts and underlying skills such that you can see a problem or question in your work and then be able to understand how you would code the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "While their are several programming languages one could use for data analysis, we chose to teach Python because it is more open-ended than alternatives (*e.g.* R being the main one for data analysis). Python is typed more like a traditional programming language, making the skills highly transferable to other languages."

    "\n",
    "Before we get started teaching any workshop, I like to point out that, like any specific domain, the way we talk about programming is almost its own language. Words in this context may have different meaning than in other contexts. As programmers ourselves, we are so used to using words in the context of programming that we sometimes forget others aren't used to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all to say, if you hear us saying a word that you're familiar with but it's obvious that we're using it in a different way, or if you hear an unfamiliar term, please ask us to explain it. This knowledge gap is one of the most difficult parts about teaching a specific topic mostly because the teachers aren't usually aware of it.\n",

    "So far, we've learned a few main things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Functions are little sub-recipes of code that perform specific tasks given the appropriate input. They are usually typed as `function_name(input1, input2, ...)`.\n",
    "2. Operators (*e.g.* `+`, `and`) can be thought of as special functions that instead take input based on what is place on either side of them.\n",
    "3. Different data types exist in programming, notably **integers** and **strings** in Python. **Functions and operators may only work for a given data type**.\n",
    "4. Complex logical statements can be constructed with **boolean** values (`True`, `False`) and the associated operators (*e.g.* `>`, `not`, `in`). Again, some of these operators only work for specific data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts form the basis of programming in any language (though the syntax will vary), however one cannot make more than very simple programs using these types of instructions alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to write complex programs that take these basic concepts and allow them to be executed based on the **conditions** of the data within a program, and to automate the **repetition** of certain instructions, we need to learn the syntax that allows us to control the flow of the program. That is where we will begin in Part 2 of the workshop!"
