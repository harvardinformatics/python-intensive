# Introduction to Python for Data Science

{{ author_row(page) }}

This is a four-day workshop that will introduce students to Python as a data science language. We teach the basics of programming and logic in the context of Python and go on to show the tools that use Python for modern data analysis. This assumes no prior knowledge of Python, but will move at a quick pace to cover all the content. The workshop meets for 3 hours for 4 sessions. 

## Getting started

These workshops are Jupyter notebooks, which are interactive Python code blocks interleaved with formatted text. You can participate in this workshop by downloading the appropriate student notebook below and then simply uploading it to [Google Colab :octicons-link-external-24:](https://colab.research.google.com/). That's it! The notebook should load and be able to run without any additional setup.
