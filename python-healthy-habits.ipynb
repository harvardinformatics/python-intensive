    "In order to write larger programs, we need to hone our skills of troubleshooting. In this section, we're going to be talking about debugging code. We typically picture debugging as something that happens when you run something and there's an error message. However, there are many other reasons why we might want to take a closer look at our code and the tips here will be useful throughout the code-writing process.\n",

    "### Asking for help\n",
    "\n",
    "Often times, the quickest way to get unstuck is to ask someone for help. There are some steps you can take to make it easier for others to help you. You may know all the context of your code, but a friend or one of us at office hours is going in fresh. Here's some information that you should provide when asking for help (in approximate order of effort):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Error message\n",
    "2. What you expected to happen\n",
    "3. What is the command you used\n",
    "4. Your environment/context\n",
    "5. A minimal reproducible example\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers 1 through 3 are the bare minimum information, while 4 and 5 are helpful for trickier problems. Number 5 is especially important if you are asking for help in an asynchronous way, like on a forum or in an email. This allows the person helping you to run code to see the error message for themselves and test out solutions before getting back to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not familiar with **minimal reproducible examples**, it's a way to pare down your code to the smallest amount that still produces the error. Often in the process of doing this, you will find the error yourself. How to make a reproducible example (AKA **reprex**)? Here are some steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a fresh script\n",
    "2. Import only the libraries you need\n",
    "3. Create only the data objects/variables you need (You may need to generate data or subset your data if it's large)\n",
    "4. Write only the code that produces the error\n",
    "5. Annotate the code with comments to explain what you are trying to do\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to then share this code (and the dummy data!) with someone else, you can either send the script to them or you can use a Python package called `reprexpy`, which will format both your code and your output in a way that is easy to post in plain text online or in an email. For more information see the docs for [reprexpy](https://reprexpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  \n",

    "### Using your IDE's tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers typically choose a text editor in which to write their code. Oftentimes, these text editors have extra features that aid programmers when coding (*e.g.* colored syntax, parentheses match highlighting, error checking). These text editors with extra featuers are called integrated development environments, or **IDEs**. RStudio is an example of an IDE, and other text editors have become so feature rich that they are essentially IDEs in practice, like [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we are working in a Jupyter notebook in Google Colab, which has IDE-like features. There are some features that might be useful for examining your code. For example, you can use the `{x}` button on the left sidebar to examine the variables in your environment. You can also use the `print()` function within blocks of your code to see what is happening at each step."

    "### Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "A very helpful approach to debugging - and, indeed, writing code in general - is to have some small input data that you can use to test. Ideally this should be something that runs fast and where you know what the expected output is. While this won't necessarily help you fix problems that cause your code to simply not execute, it can be extremely useful if you are not certain of how to program something, or if your program is running but with unexpected results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have a dataset that you have manually processed, but now want to automate with a Python script or set of scripts, you will very likely want to check your code by running it against a test input that has a known output.\n",

While you can sprinkle `#comments` throughout your program, there are also some standardized ways to do so.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Exception handling** is a fundamental concept in Python that allows you to manage and respond to errors gracefully, ensuring that a program can continue running or fail in a controlled manner. When your code encounters an issue—such as trying to divide by zero, accessing a file that doesn't exist, or converting user input to the wrong type—Python **raises** an \"exception.\" Without proper handling, these exceptions can (and usually do) cause your program to crash, or worse create unpredictable bugs. This is called an **unhandled exception**. By using **try and except blocks**, you can anticipate potential errors, catch these exceptions, and define alternative actions or informative messages for the user.\n",

    "**Answer:** Any number between 0 and 13, depending on the time zones of the two locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time, as we all know, is a human construct that is on its face numerical, but is also more complex than simple numbers. Consider all that we do with dates and times: we want to compare time, do arithmetic to find time intervals, aggregate by year, month, day, day of the week, etc. Time consists of many different units and cannot be simply added or coded. Consider that there are a variable number of days in a month, and some months have different number of days on certain years (leap days). Then, we might want to measure durations of time, or keep track of time stamps specific to a location and date. These require computers to think of time in different ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has an implementation of datetime objects called `pd.datetime`. Consider this akin to the `str` object for strings, or the `int` object for integers. This object has a lot of built-in functionality that makes it easy to work with dates and times. But before we learn how to convert data to this object type, let's go over a few basic tips for how to record your time data. \n",
    "\n",
    "* If you just want to record the date, use the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. When you convert to a `pd.datetime` object, it will automatically set the time to midnight with no time zone information. This is called a \"naive\" datetime object.\n",
    "* If you need to record a timestamp - e.g. the time and date something happened - use the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS+0500`. This is the ISO 8601 standard format for datetime objects. The `+0500` is the time zone offset from GMT. When pandas parses this string, it will create what is called an \"aware\" datetime object. ***Good data practice is to always record your times in this format and to always include the time zone offset*** unless you are absolutely sure that A. Everything happens in the same time zone and you'll never have to compare to another dataset, and B. None of your data will be affected by daylight savings time.\n",
    "* If you need to record a time series, you want to record the time a `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` (ISO 8601 again) but import the data as **time deltas**, aka `pd.Timedelta`. This is a special type of datetime object that represents the difference between two times. This is useful if the duration, and not the specific time of day, matters the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is an essential library for time series analysis that many other libraries build upon. See the docs for more information on how pandas handles date [time objects](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/timeseries.html) and [time deltas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/timedeltas.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you aren't doing time series analysis, you will find it useful to import any column of dates or times as a datetime object, as it will provide you with a lot of useful functionality. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pandas can automatically parse human readable dates and times written in various formats into a standardized `datetime` object. [docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.to_datetime.html)\n",
    "* You can extract various components of the date/time for analysis or printing purposes. See the list of attributes and method of the `pd.Timestamp` class [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Timestamp.html), which include `day_of_week`, `day_of_year`, `weekofyear`, `.day_name()`, etc. \n",
    "* You can perform calculations on dates and times, such as converting between time zones, finding the difference (**delta**) between two times, resampling the frequency of a time series, or finding the time that is a certain duration away from a given time. \n",
    "* You can control how the date is displayed when you print it out or export your data by using string format codes specific for datetime objects. [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#format-codes) \n",
