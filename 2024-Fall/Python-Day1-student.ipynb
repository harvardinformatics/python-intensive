    "2. Create a new environment using mamba with `mamba create -n pyworkshop numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter` and activate it with `conda activate pyworkshop`.\n",
    "3. You can now run the jupyter notebook by typing `jupyter notebook` in the terminal. This will open a browser window with the jupyter notebook interface. You can navigate to the folder where you saved this notebook and open it.\n",

As we'll see when we cover lists, you can use the `[]` to specify portions of the string, such as a specific position or use `:` to specify an interval. Using `:` is called **slicing**. When you slice, the beginning of the slice is included, but the end isn't. So `[1:5]` will get you characters 2-4. You can even skip characters during slicing by adding another number after the colon to specify the interval to retrieve items. So `[::2]` will get you every other character from the string. Indices can also be negative numbers, which will cause the counting to begin at the end of the object. For example, `[-1]` gets the last character of the string."
