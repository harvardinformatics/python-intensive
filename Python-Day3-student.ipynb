    "\n",
    "Welcome to day 3 of our python intensive course. This is the last day of the \"introduction to computer science\" part of the course, after which we will move on to the \"introduction to data science\" part. Let's review what we have learned so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A computer program is a sequence of instructions that is read from top to bottom and executed by the computer. You need to give it extremely precise instructions. It's helpful to use **pseudocode** to plan our the logic of your program before you apply the **syntax** of your programming language.\n",
    "2. **Variables** are assigned to data using the `=` operator. \n",
    "3. **Functions** are blocks of code that are executed when called. You can also think of operators as functions that take arguments on both sides. \n",
    "4. We learned about various data types, including **integers**, **strings**, and **booleans** and how various operators work with them. Knowing what data type you are working with is very important!\n",
    "5. **Conditional statements** like `if`, `elif`, `else` allow you to control the flow of the program, skipping code that doesn't need to be executed.\n",
    "6. **Loops** like `for` and `while` allow you to repeat code multiple times. For while loops, it's important to make sure that it will end by using an update variable. For loops use iterables to repeat code. \n",
    "7. **Iterables** are objects that can be looped over, like **lists**, **dictionaries**, and **strings**. They are indexed starting at 0 and can be sliced using the `:` operator.\n",
    "8. **Lists** are a basic data structure that store multiple values. They are indexed by their position in the list. \n",
    "9. While learning about lists, we learned about methods, which are functions that are attached to objects and can modify that object **in place** or give you information about that object. \n",
    "10. **Dictionaries** are another type of basic data structure that store key-value pairs. They are indexed by their keys.\n",
    "11. How to write **functions** of your own and either print the results or return the values. "

    "A very helpful approach to debugging - and, indeed, writing code in general - is to have some small input data that you can use to test. Ideally this should be something that runs fast and where you know what the expected output is. While this won't necessarily help you fix problems that cause your code to simply not execute, it can be extremely useful if you are not certain of how to program something, or if your program is running but with unexpected results. \n",
    "\n",

This allows the person helping you to run code to see the error message for themselves and test out solutions before getting back to you. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not familiar with **minimal reproducible examples**, it's a way to pare down your code to the smallest amount that still produces the error. Often in the process of doing this, you will find the error yourself. How to make a reproducible example (AKA **reprex**)? Here are some steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a fresh script\n",

    "4. Write only the code that produces the error\n",
    "5. Annotate the code with comments to explain what you are trying to do\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to then share this code (and the dummy data!) with someone else, you can either send the script to them or you can use a Python package called `reprexpy`, which will format both your code and your output in a way that is easy to post in plain text online or in an email.

These text editors with extra featuers are called integrated development environments, or **IDEs**. RStudio is an example of an IDE, and other text editors have become so feature rich that they are essentially IDEs in practice, like [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n",

When your code encounters an issue—such as trying to divide by zero, accessing a file that doesn't exist, or converting user input to the wrong type—Python **raises** an \"exception.\" Without proper handling, these exceptions can (and usually do) cause your program to crash, or worse create unpredictable bugs. This is called an **unhandled exception**. By using try and except blocks, you can anticipate potential errors, catch these exceptions, and define alternative actions or informative messages for the user. \n",

That is, **code annotation**. When you begin to write longer functions or scripts, it's important to leave breadcrumbs for yourself (and others) about what your code does. While you can sprinkle `#comments` throughout your program, there are also some standardized ways to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are annotating functions, you should use something called a **\"docstring\"**. This is a string that is the first line of a function and is enclosed in triple quotes. It should describe what the function does, what inputs it takes, and what it returns. Here is an example of a docstring:\n",
